# Data Structures

Data Structure is a systematic way to organize data in order to use it efficiently. Following 
terms are the foundation terms of a data structure.

**Interface:**
Each data structure has an interface that represents the list of operations, type of parameters they accept.

**Implementation:**
Internal representation and definition of an algorithm.

## Characteristics of a Data Structure

**Correctness:**    Implement interface correctly

**Time Complexity:**    Running time of Data Structure operations must be small.

**Space Complexity:**   Memory storage must be small as possible

### Need For Data Structure

- **Data Search**   
Search data efficiently from large data sets.

- **Processor Speed**   
Less impact on processor performance

- **Multiple requests**    
Handle multiple search requests simultaneously

## Execution time cases

There are three cases which are usually used to compare various data structure's execution 
time in a relative manner.

### 1. Worst Case

This is the scenario where a particular data structure operation takes maximum time it can take. If an operation's worst case time is ƒ(n) then this operation will not take more than ƒ(n) time, where ƒ(n) represents function 
of n.

### 2. Average Case

This is the scenario depicting the average execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then m operations will take mƒ(n) time.

### 3. Best Case

This is the scenario depicting the least possible execution time of an operation of a data structure. If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then the actual operation may take time as the random number which would be 
maximum as ƒ(n).
