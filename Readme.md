# Data Structure and Algorithms using **Python**

 This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implementations in Python. Following along with this repository requires fundamental knowledge of programming in python, for that checkout this Repository. [Python-OOP](https://github.com/sarmad426/Python-OOP). It covers all the essential topics, do checkout this because this repository assumes essential knowledge of programming.

### How to Use This Repository

- **Learning**: If you are new to DSA, start by exploring the theoretical documents to build a strong foundation. Then, dive into the code examples and implement data structures and algorithms from scratch.

- **Leetcode Interview Problems**: Use the Leetcode interview questions section to practice and improve your problem-solving skills. Understand the logic behind each solution and try to solve them independently first.

All of the practical examples are written using **python** programming. If you wanna use **C++** we also have an amazing resource for this. Checkout this repository [DSA-C++](https://github.com/sarmad426/DSA)
