# Algorithms

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

**Categories:**

- Insert
- Update
- Sort
- Search
- Delete

## Characteristics of an algorithm

- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output.
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in specific order.
- The steps also need to be distinct. (They can't be further broken down.)
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in finite amount of time.

## How to write an Algorithm

There are no well-defined standards for writing algorithms. Rather, it is problem and resource dependent. Algorithms are never written to support a particular programming code.

### Example

**Problem** − Design an algorithm to add two numbers and display the result.

```algo
step 1 − START ADD
step 2 − get values of a & b
step 3 − c ← a + b
step 4 − display c
step 5 − STOP
```

## Algorithm Complexity

### 1. Time Factor

Time is measured by counting the number of key operations such as comparisons in the sorting algorithm.

### 2. Space Factor

Space is measured by counting the maximum memory space required by the algorithm.
